// Powers of 2 Assignment:
// Powers of 2

// File PowersOf2.java contains a skeleton of a program to read in an integer from the user and print out that many powers of 2, starting with 20.

// 1. Using the comments as a guide, complete the program so that it prints out the number of powers of 2 that the user requests. Do not use Math.pow to compute the powers of 2! Instead, compute each power from the previous one (how do you get 2n from 2nâ€“1?). For example, if the user enters 4, your program should print this:

// Here are the first 4 powers of 2:

// 1248

// 2. Modify the program so that instead of just printing the powers, you print which power each is, e.g.:

// Here are the first 4 powers of 2:

// 2^0 = 1

// 2^1 = 2

// 2^2 = 4

// 2^3 = 8
