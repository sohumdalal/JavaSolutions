Easy (5 Challenges)

-Sum of an Array
Write a program that takes an array of integers and prints the sum of all its elements.
Example: Given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output should be 15.

-Average of Array Elements
Write a program to calculate the average of the elements in an array of integers.
Example: Given [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], the output should be 30.

-Find the Maximum Value
Write a program that finds and prints the maximum value in an array of integers.
Example: Given [7, 3, 9, 5, 1], the output should be 9.

-Count Even and Odd Numbers
Write a program that counts the number of even and odd numbers in an array of integers.
Example: Given [2, 5, 8, 13, 7], the output should be Evens: 2, Odds: 3.

-Fibonacci with Cache
Write a program to compute the Fibonacci sequence using a cache (also known as memoization). 
Store previously computed Fibonacci numbers in an array (or a HashMap) to avoid redundant calculations.
The nth Fibonacci number can be written as fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) ... and so on. 
Note that: fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1. Example: fib(6) should return 8 (sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8).

-Factorial with Cache
Write a program that calculates the factorial 
 n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1. factorial(5) should return 120.

-Palindrome
Problem: Write a method isPalindrome(String str) that checks if a given string str is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards.
Example: isPalindrome("racecar") should return true.

-Char counter
Write a method that takes a string and a character, then counts how many times the character appears in the string.

-2-Sum Problem (Classic)
Write a program that finds two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target. Print the indices of the two numbers.
Example: Given [2, 7, 11, 15] and target 9, the output should be Indices: 0, 1.

-Reverse an Array
Write a program that reverses an array of integers and prints the reversed array.
Example: Given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output should be [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
